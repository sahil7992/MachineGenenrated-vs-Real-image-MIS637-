Real vs AI Image Detector
This Python project includes a set of scripts designed to differentiate between real images and AI-generated images. It utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet152 model to classify images into these two categories effectively.

Description
Data Setup: Scripts to prepare and split images into training and testing sets, ensuring a variety of examples for both real and AI-generated images.
Model Training: Adjustments and fine-tuning of the ResNet152 model for specific classification tasks.
Image Prediction: Functions to predict whether new images are real or AI-generated, including visualization of these predictions.
Accuracy Measurement: Utility functions to calculate and report the accuracy of the model during training and testing phases.
Output Showcase
Below are some examples of the image classification results obtained using this detector. The images show the predicted category along with the probability score.
